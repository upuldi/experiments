        <h2>Natural Rubber Prices</h2>
        <p>Rubber is a polymer consisting of hydrogen and carbon and is elastic in nature. It is found in the fluid of some specific plants but it can also be produced synthetically. Naturally, rubber is produced by the process of tapping of the plant called Hevea Brasiliensis. These plants generally have 32 years of economic life but they may live up to 100 years or even more than that. Synthetic rubber is produced through the process of polymerization of various monomers.</p>
        <p>Rubber is an appealing item of trade for those involved in commodity trading as the material has a wide range of practical applications and around 90% of natural rubber produced is used for export purposes. This therefore indicates a large market and a high demand for the product, which are attractive qualities to any trader than has the ability to accurately predict future fluctuations in the rubber commodity price.</p>

        <p>Since rubber is one of the world’s primary industrial commodities, rubber trading is widespread, with the rubber commodity being traded on a number of commodity exchanges. These include the Tokyo Commodity Exchange (TOCOM) (where the ticker symbols are TCE/JRU on Reuters and JNA on Bloomberg), the Osaka Mercantile Exchange (OME) (where the ticker symbols are JRI, JKR and JOS), the Singapore Commodity Exchange (contract codes RSS3 and TSR20) and two Indian exchanges: the National Commodity and Derivatives Exchange (NCDEX) (ticker symbol: RBRRS4KOC) and the Multi Commodity Exchange (ticker symbol: RUBBER).</p>

        <p>The rubber trade is centred around the automotive industry, as tyres, auto tubes and other automobile parts are all constructed out of rubber. Rubber is also used in cabling, in the manufacture of footwear and in the manufacture of various latex items. Thailand is the largest producer of rubber in the world, manufacturing an estimated 2357000 tons a year, with Indonesia producing 1543000 tons a year. In terms of market consumption, rubber is consumed the most in the USA, with China, Japan and India following behind. Thailand, as well as being the largest rubber producer, is also the leader in the field in terms of research and development of synthetic rubber production methods. India is expected to becoming a leader in terms of production in the next decade due to several factors that work to its advantage. It has an extensive plantation sector and has the indigenous availability of most of the basic raw materials such as natural rubber and rayon. The domestic market is substantial and when this is coupled with the fact that labour is available at relatively low costs, it is easy to see why India can in a very short period of time become a major player in the rubber market. The emergence of India as a serious player in the rubber market will have a marked effect on the rubber market price.</p>

        <p>Rubber commodity prices are affected by a number of factors. The current demand for automobile tyres will cause the spot price of rubber to fluctuate dramatically over the course of a year, whereas rubber futures are affected by various government policies concerning subsidies and trade restrictions. The rubber market can also be affected by the weather, as rubber production tends to decrease dramatically during periods of heavy rain.</p>

        <p>The outlook for rubber prices is linked to global and Chinese economic growth.Prices slumped 49 percent to 273 yen since reaching an all-time high of 535.7 yen on Feb. 18 on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange. Global car production was disrupted by the earthquake and tsunami in Japan in March and then by flooding in Thailand in the fourth quarter. </p>

        <p>Rubber is the fifth worst-performing commodity among 80 tracked by Bloomberg in the past 12 months, behind two carbon contracts, rhodium and ruthenium. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI of 24 raw materials rose 6.7 percent as the MSCI All-Country World Index of equities dropped 8.1 percent. Treasuries returned 9.5 percent, a Bank of America Corp. index shows.</p>

        <p>Synthetic rubber may still not be enough to diminish the anticipated glut of natural rubber, which also faces more competition from synthetics. The material, derived from crude oil, fell 38 percent to $2,750 a ton in the four months through the end of November, according to data from Sutton, Surrey-based ICIS, a petrochemical research company.</p>

        <p>Growing demand for rubber may not be reflected by higher prices because of concern about Europe’s debt crisis and slowing growth in China, said Kitichai Sincharoenkul, executive director of Sri Trang. Sales may gain 15 percent to 1.15 million tons, he said, declining to comment on the outlook for profit.</p>

        <p>The period of high growth in natural rubber demand has ended, said Zhao Cheng, a commodities analyst at Zhongcai Futures Co. in Chongqing, China. The whole manufacturing sector is in contraction and natural rubber demand will certainly grow at a slower pace.</p>
