<h1>Free Frames Template Kit 007</h1>
<p><img src="images/p0319676.jpg" width="300" height="200" align="right" alt="Frames kit 007">We're in the process of replacing our frames template kits with W3C compliant documents.</p>
<p>They are all created in fluid designs which will adjust to the width of the visiting browser window.  They will also adjust to different monitor resolutions.</p>
<h2>No More Framespacing</h2>
