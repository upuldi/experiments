<h2>Side Bar</h2>
<p>The Side Bar can be used to display small pictures, ads and even articles.</p>
<h2>Why Go Liquid?</h2>
<p>The majority of websites built these days use static or fixed width structures.</p>
<p>Most of the fixed width pages on those websites are set to 1000 pixels or wider.</p>
<p>Every year we see new devices sent to the marketplace that can be used to browse websites. Tablets, smaller and smaller notebooks and other devices appear all the time.</p>
<p>Some of these new devices have screens as small as seven inches and viewing resolutions as low as 800x600.</p>
<p>A visitor viewing a static web page on a device with an 800x600 viewing resolution would have to scroll 200 pixels to the right to see all of the static page.</p>
<p>Properly designed liquid web pages would conform to the visitor's device and require no scrolling to view.</p>
<h2>Side Margins</h2>
<p>We added the side margins to these designs to keep the page from spreading out too much at higher resolutions.</p>
<p>The side margins can be adjusted or removed at the top of your style sheet.</p>

<h2>Site Map</h2>
<!--Edit side links here - Add remove as needed-->
<p><a href="index.html">Home</a></p>
<p><a href="contact.html">Contact</a></p>
<br>
<h2>Extra Side Bar</h2>
<p>If your Navigation menu doesn't fill enough space in the column, you can use it as an extra sidebar.</p>
<h2>Keep It Simple</h2>
<p>A lot of folks get carried away these days when building websites.</p>
<p>They add so many gadgets to the design that the main purpose of the website is lost in the foray.</p>
<p>The main focus of any website should be its content. Simple design always out performs the gadget website.</p>
<h2>Testing Your Work</h2>
<p>As with any website you should test your website on as many different browsers as possible.</p>
<p>When creating liquid websites you also want to test your website at different monitor resolutions.</p>
<p>You should also get into the habit of checking your HTML code and CSS at the W3C Validation Service.</p>
