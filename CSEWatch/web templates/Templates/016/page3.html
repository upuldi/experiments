<h1>Navigation Bar</h1>
<p>You can easily add and remove buttons to the navigation bar..</p>
<p>This template displays 7 buttons to a row at most resolutions.  Adjust the height of the navigation row on index.html according to the number of rows you want to dislpay.</p>
<p>You'll also need to adjust the height of the topnavigate division in the style sheet.</p>
<p>Add the links with page names and urls for the additional buttons to navigation.html.</p>
<p>You could also add scrolling if desired.  It looked a bit tacky to me so I left it non-scrolling.</p>
<p>If creating a website with a lot of web pages it would probably be best to create a links page that targets into the content window.  We added the Website Resources page as an example.</p>
