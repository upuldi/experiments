<h1>Free Frames Template Kit 004</h1>
<p><img src="images/p0400521.jpg" width="300" height="200" align="left" border="1" alt="Frames kit 004">We're in the process of replacing our frames template kits with W3C compliant documents.</p>
<p>They are all created in fluid designs which will adjust to the width of the visiting browser window.  They will also adjust to different monitor resolutions.</p>
<h2>No More Framespacing</h2>
<p>Our old templates used the framespacing attribute to close the gaps between frames. This was the main cause of our web pages not validating.  If you want validated web pages using frames, you must live with the ugly frame borders or the unsightly gap that exists when you remove the borders.</p>
<p>There are some hacker fixes that you can use, but they are too complicated for most of our beginner oriented clientel.</p>
<h2>Contact Form</h2>
<p>All of the new templates include a contact page which can be easily activated and used to interact with your users.  Instructions are given on the web page.</p>
<h2>Redirection</h2>
<p>All of the pages include redirection code.  Any page which is accessed will redirect to the main frameset web page.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Need Web Hosting</h2>
